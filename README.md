**#first web project by walter-mittie**

The project is to create a simple website in html that allows users to browse various food recipes. As part of the project a homepage that contains a header and an unordered list of recipe names with links to individual recipe pages was set up. The individual pages contained the header, image of the food item, a short description, unordered list of ingredients and an ordered list of preparation steps. Each individual page also had a hyperlink at the bottom to navigate back to the homepage. All the navigation links in the project were set up as relative links where as all the image sources were set up as absolute links.
