                <p>
                    Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles. It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat, which means a few things: Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, and it benefits greatly from marination. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below.

                    <li>12 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
                    <li>1 ½ tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                </ul>
            <h3 class="sub header">Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Whisk together oil, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, and pepper for marinade in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish until thoroughly combined.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add flank steak to the baking dish; turn several times to coat thoroughly with marinade. Cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours, or up to 12 hours if you have time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cook steak on the preheated grill for about 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove from the grill and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.
                    </li>
                </ol>
