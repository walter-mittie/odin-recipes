            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Top with classic condiments like mustard, ketchup, and mayo for full-fledged flavor.
                    </li>
                </ol>
